                Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever
                teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up
                drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing
                information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the
                test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived
                its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will
                be retained. In the end, we're really just lear ning how to pass
                our tests.

                <strong>Here's the real question:</strong> does this approach of
                repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject
                material? The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In
                fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing
                how to study, but for some reason, this point is often
                overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?
